### 1.1 Non-Commercial Use

Users who do not monetize the Software, including but not limited to using it on public Minecraft servers that feature stores and/or donation pages, are granted unrestricted permission to use the Software, as well as modify and redistribute the Software .

### 1.2 Commercial Use

Users who seek to monetize the Software, including but not limited to hosting it on Minecraft servers that feature stores and/or donation pages, or incorporating it into revenue-generating modpacks, must obtain explicit, written permission from the author, EasySqueeze, before doing so. Denial of permission by EasySqueeze does not require a reason, valid or otherwise, as approval is entirely within his discretion. The Software’s name must be listed in a visible location such as a server mod list, modpack info file, or equivalent public-facing documentation. Attempting to conceal the use of AllTheMons or AllTheMons assets is strictly prohibited.

### 1.3 Modification & Redistribution

Modified copies may be redistributed so long as they include in their title the term “AllTheMons”, and are not in any way monetized. Under no circumstances may any individual or entity, other than the author (see 3. Revenue Distribution & Author Compliance), monetize modified or unmodified copies of the Software. This includes but is not limited to redistributing modified copies of the Software publicly under a name that does not include the term “AllTheMons”, or incorporating it into Minecraft servers that feature donation or store pages as previously outlined.

If a modified version of the Software includes altered or derivative artistic assets (including but not limited to models, animations, and textures) originally created by third-party contributors, the author of the modified pack must:

1. Obtain express written permission from the original creator(s) of those artistic assets prior to any public redistribution of the modified version;

2. Provide clear and conspicuous credit to the original creator(s), both:  
- Within the software itself, and

- On any site or platform where the modified version is distributed.

Redistribution of the modified version is not permitted under this license until all the above conditions are fully met.

## 2. Liability & Warranty Disclaimer

The Software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The author shall not be held liable for any damages, including but not limited to data loss, server failures, or other issues resulting from the modification of the Software or from the use of modified copies of the Software.

## 3. Revenue Distribution & Author Compliance

Any revenue generated from the Software must be evenly distributed among all consenting contributors to the Software. Any revenue generated must be transparently reported and distributed among contributors per a mutually agreed-upon arrangement. Both the author and contributors must comply with the terms set forth in this license in their own use of the Software.
